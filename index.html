            <p>
                Hello all, My name is Samuel Jenkins. I am from Clarkston Michigan. I am curently in my
                4th year at MSU, a "senior" per se. I graduated from Lake Orion High School in 2018. I have
                spent half of my life living across the pond. When i was a wee lad, my mom wanted to move closer
                to her parents, in which they lived in belgium. Thus meaning i know a little flemish, and some bad
                french! I am a big Fulham supporter, I ran track and cross country in high school and played club futbol
                for Vardar Michigan! Here below are some goals of mine, sort and long term!
