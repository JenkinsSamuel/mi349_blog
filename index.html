            <p> This is my legit but honest pizza review of the Hungry Howies in Okemos... Ok, where to begin. so fist off i was heavily intrigued by the coupon that had shown up in my mailbox
                so, obvoiulsy being a college student, 2 mediam pizzas and a howie bread for $15 was a no brainer. So, using the online portal, i proceeded with caution, looking for catches to the deal
                and started my order. i added to pepperoni pizzas to my cart and was given the hard decision of what kind of bread to choose. many option might i say so myself. I weighed my options while 
                creating a decision making matrix and chose the original bread. placed the order, entered my card information and was on my way to go pick it up. i was dreading the drive there as the tahoe
                i drive cost $79 dollars to fill up today... unlucky really. drove myself to the brick and mortor store and picked it up. twas ready when i arrived too, so i left a tip. 
                8/10, overall good experience, would do again.

                    okay, for the actual pizza review! Being a michiganer at heart, i have already tried hungy howies pizza, first of all i worked at one while i was in high school and
                    it was the closest pizza place that delievered to my house in the boonies. first off, i would like to state that i was hesitant to order from a pizza joint like HH, due to the fact that
                    i know what happens when pizzas are made... would rather have a clean metal machine make the pizza for me. The pepperoni pizza was overall good, 4.7/10. good for a fast order pizza. 
                    the cheese bread on the other hand was god awful. it was dry to eat, and was covered in butter, to the point where i have stains on my shirt now because of it. that i would score a 1.01/10
                    cant give full number scores as that is a rookie mistake, one i would not make! next on the review list is cottage inn. i have had many of their pizzas, but have never 
                    fully reviewed one.
